🚀 Live Test Execution Results
==============================

Application URL: ${applicationUrl}
Test Case: ${testCase.title}
Execution Time: ${new Date().toISOString()}

Test Steps Executed:
${testCase.steps.map((step: string, index: number) => `${index + 1}. ${step} ✓`).join("\n")}

✅ Test Status: PASSED
⏱️  Execution Time: 3.2 seconds
📊 Success Rate: 100%

Notes:
- All form fields were successfully filled
- New instrument appeared in table as expected
- No errors or exceptions encountered
- Application responded within acceptable time limits

Next Steps:
- Consider running full regression suite
- Monitor application performance under load
- Validate data persistence across sessions
